# NodeMCU
Working on a ESP module

Initial Steps:
1. Install Arduino IDE
2. Download USB driver to work with NOdeMCU
    I have to browse around 2 hours to find the appropriate driver for my computer.

    Is the link that successfully help me program the board. (My system is Mac Sierra 10.12.3)
3.Use any example from the Arduino IDE. WifiScan is what I tried and it was successful.

Serial Output:
